# DHAI_2024_TD_LLM - Group Project 2:
This repository contains the main materials for the PSL-Week "Digital Humanities meets Artificial Intelligence" project on LLMs for fiction..


This project aims to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a tool for studying fiction. The objective is to assess the extent to which LLMs can generate the continuation of a given text. The primary research question arises from a shared assumption in literary studies: the plot's dependence on subgenres. Therefore, we will investigate this hypothesis by examining the impact of fine-tuning on the LLMs' ability to predict the plot. Throughout the week, we will address several questions, such as: Can LLMs effectively predict the unfolding events in a novel? How can we assess their performance? What changes in results occur when specializing (fine-tuning) LLMs on subgenres ? The week will include learning how to implement small LLMs in Python and conducting completion tasks locally. Comparisons between the actual novel, the LLM predictions, and students' creative writing will be conducted. One potential research output for the week could be gaining insights into which genres are the most codified.
